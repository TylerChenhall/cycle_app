# Cycle App

An application for observing and understanding activity choice and completion.

## Motivation

This project started as a way to observe and improve how I make decisions throughout the day.

The basic idea is to break each day into _cycles_, which are small time blocks spent on a single activity. At the start of each cycle, the user nominates 3 possible activities, and chooses one. The user then spends a short block of time on the chosen activity.

__This is not a productivity application__, though improved productivity may be a side-effect of following this method.

Key features include

* Frequent opportunities to consider which activities are meaningful, relevant, or important
* Frequent, intentional choice of action
* Data collection for future reflection

## Status

This project is casually in-development [I add features when they seem particularly useful]

Currently, basic cycle management, data recording, and browsing are implemented. Follow-up analysis is still very limited, and the application only supports a single user.
